                <h3>Human metapneumovirus (HMPV)</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>What it is: HMPV is a respiratory virus that causes infections in the upper and lower respiratory tracts. It is similar to illnesses like the common cold and flu.</li>
                    <li>How it spreads: HMPV spreads through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes. It can also spread by touching surfaces contaminated with the virus.</li>
                    <li>Symptoms: Symptoms of HMPV infection include cough, fever, runny nose, and difficulty breathing. In severe cases, it can lead to pneumonia or bronchiolitis.</li>
                    <li>Treatment: There is no specific treatment for HMPV infection, but supportive care can help manage symptoms. In severe cases, hospitalization may be necessary.</li>
                    <li>Prevention: To prevent HMPV infection, practice good hygiene, such as washing hands frequently and avoiding close contact with sick individuals.</li>

                <h3>Goods and Service Tax (GST)</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>What is GST: GST is a consumption-based tax levied on the supply of goods and services. It is an indirect tax that replaces multiple taxes levied by the central and state governments.</li>
                    <li>How it works: Under the GST system, goods and services are taxed at multiple stages, from production to consumption. The tax is collected at each stage of the supply chain and passed on to the consumer.</li>
                    <li>Benefits of GST: GST simplifies the tax system by eliminating multiple taxes and reducing the compliance burden on businesses. It also promotes transparency and accountability in the tax system.</li>
                    <li>Challenges of GST: Implementing GST can be complex, as it requires significant changes to the tax system and infrastructure. It also requires businesses to adapt to new tax laws and regulations.</li>
                    <li>Impact of GST: GST has had a significant impact on the Indian economy, leading to increased tax compliance, reduced tax evasion, and improved tax revenues for the government.</li>
